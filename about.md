Hi, I’m **Tushar** — a Master’s student in **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology** at the University of South Florida. I completed my undergraduate studies in **B.Sc. (Hons) Biotechnology**, where I developed a strong foundation in molecular biology, genomics, and data analysis.

I’ve always had a passion for biology — and more recently, I’ve developed a deep interest in **artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)**. This blog is my way of combining both worlds.

### Why This Blog?

I created **Bioinformaniac** to:

- Share real-world projects I’m working on in bioinformatics, cancer research, and ML
- Break down technical concepts as I learn them
- Build a transparent record of how I’m improving — both as a researcher and as a learner

Everything here is written from the perspective of a student who’s still learning — but learning hard. If you’re also figuring things out one dataset at a time, I hope this blog helps you too.
