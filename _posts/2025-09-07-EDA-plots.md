## TL;DR (Cheat-Sheet)
- **Scatter plot (num vs num):** relationships, clusters, outliers.  
- **Box plot (num vs cat):** compare distributions across categories.  
- **Count plot (cat):** check balance of classes.  
- **Pie chart (cat):** quick snapshot of proportions (≤5 groups).  
- **Bar plot (num vs cat, aggregated):** compare means or totals.  
- **KDE plot (num):** visualize smooth distribution curves.  
- **Heatmap (cat vs cat):** show counts/associations in cross-tabs.  
- **Line plot (num vs time):** track changes and trends over time.

## Why Plots Matter in EDA
Numbers in tables can hide structure. Visuals reveal **relationships, trends, and anomalies** instantly.  
The trick isn’t just to *make plots* — it’s knowing **which plot answers which question**.  
This guide shows the core EDA plot types, when to use them, and what to look for.  

---

## Scatter Plot — numeric vs numeric
**When to use:** explore relationships between two numeric variables.  
- Highlights **correlations**, **clusters**, and **outliers**.  
- Can add color (`hue`) or style (`marker`) for subgroup comparisons.

|---|---|---|
| **hue = treatment** (vs expr1) | **hue,style = treatment,stage** (vs expr2) | **hue = stage** (vs expr2) |

> Example use: `expr1` vs `expr2` to check if expression levels rise together.

## Box Plot — numeric vs categorical
**When to use:** compare numeric distributions across categories.  
- Median, quartiles, and outliers are visible at a glance.  
- Useful for spotting **differences in spread** or **group medians**.

|---|---|---|
| **hue = cancer** (vs expr1) | **hue = treatment** (vs expr1) | **hue = cancer** (vs age) |

> Add jittered/swarm points for more transparency about sample sizes.  
{: .prompt-warning }

## Count Plot — categorical counts
**When to use:** check **balance** across categories.  
- Especially important before classification tasks.  
- Imbalanced classes can bias models and metrics.  

![Count Plot](https://tushar-bioinfo.github.io/learning-bioinformatics/assets/img/blog4/plot6.png){: width="500" height="500" }

> Can add `hue` to compare counts across subgroups.  
{: .prompt-tip }  

---

## Pie Chart — composition snapshot
**When to use:** quick sense of proportions (≤5 categories).  
- Clear for presentations, less precise for analysis.  
- Percentages communicate the part-to-whole relationship.

![Pie Plot](https://tushar-bioinfo.github.io/learning-bioinformatics/assets/img/blog4/plot7.png){: width="500" height="500" }

> Switch to bar plots if you need exact comparison between groups.  
{: .prompt-danger }  

---

## Bar Plot — aggregated numeric vs categorical
**When to use:** compare aggregated values (mean, sum, median) across categories.  
- Clean view of group averages or totals.  
- Often paired with error bars for uncertainty.  

![Bar Plot](https://tushar-bioinfo.github.io/learning-bioinformatics/assets/img/blog4/plot8.png){: width="500" height="500" }

> Great for high-level summaries; switch to box/violin if you care about spread.  
{: .prompt-tip }  

---

## KDE Plot — numeric distribution
**When to use:** understand the **shape of a distribution**.  
- Smooth alternative to histograms.  
- Highlights peaks, skewness, and multimodality.

![KDE Plot](https://tushar-bioinfo.github.io/learning-bioinformatics/assets/img/blog4/plot9.png){: width="500" height="500" }

> Adjust smoothing with `bw_adjust` to reveal or hide detail.  
{: .prompt-warning }  

---

## Heatmap — categorical × categorical
**When to use:** explore associations between two categorical variables.  
- Each cell shows frequency (or percentage) of a category pair.  
- Color gradient highlights over- or under-represented combinations.  

![Heatmap](https://tushar-bioinfo.github.io/learning-bioinformatics/assets/img/blog4/plot10.png){: width="500" height="500" }

> Combine with chi-square tests to test if association is statistically significant.  
{: .prompt-tip }  

---

## Line Plot — numeric vs time
**When to use:** follow **trends and patterns** across time.  
- Ideal for daily/weekly/monthly metrics.  
- Useful for spotting **spikes**, **seasonality**, or **drift**.

![Line Plot](https://tushar-bioinfo.github.io/learning-bioinformatics/assets/img/blog4/plot11.png){: width="500" height="500" }

> Smooth with rolling averages to highlight long-term patterns.  
{: .prompt-warning }

## Final-Notes
EDA plots are your **first microscope into data**:  
- Scatter plots show *relationships*.  
- Box/bar plots compare *groups*.  
- Count/pie plots check *balance*.  
- KDE/heatmaps reveal *distributions and associations*.  
- Line plots capture *trends over time*.  

The goal isn’t to generate every plot — it’s to pick the **simplest visualization that answers your question clearly**.
