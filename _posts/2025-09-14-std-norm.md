## TL;DR (Cheat-Sheet)
- **Normalization (Min–Max):** squeezes values into a fixed range, usually [0, 1].  
- **Standardization (Z-score):** shifts mean to 0 and scales spread to 1.  
- **Why scale?** Puts features on a fair scale so distance- or gradient-based models don’t get biased by “big number” features.  
- **Use scaling for:** kNN, SVM, Logistic/Linear Regression, Neural Nets, PCA, k-Means.  
- **Skip scaling for:** Tree-based models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost) — they don’t care about scale.

## Why Scaling Matters
Imagine two features:
- `Glucose`: values around **3000**  
- `GeneScore`: values around **0.01**

To a distance-based model, `Glucose` completely dominates. Scaling fixes this imbalance, letting models treat both features fairly.

## Before Scaling

> **Observation:** x-axis spans thousands, y-axis hugs near zero. Without scaling, the smaller-scale feature is almost invisible to the model.

## After Min–Max Normalization
**Formula:**  


## After Min–Max Normalization
**Formula:**  

$$
x_{norm} = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}
$$

> **How to read this:** Both features now live between 0 and 1. The shapes are preserved, but the scale is uniform. A step of 0.1 means the same normalized change for both features.

## After Standardization (Z-score)
**Formula:**  

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

> **How to read this:** Features are centered around 0 with similar spread (~1). Models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and many Neural Nets train more stably here.

## When to Use What
- **Normalization (Min–Max):** when you want strict bounds [0, 1] or when the next step (like a neural net with sigmoid activations) expects inputs in that range.  
- **Standardization (Z-score):** strong general default, especially for gradient-based models and PCA.  
- **No scaling needed:** tree-based models (they split on thresholds, not distances).  

---

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Data leakage:** Always fit the scaler on **training only**, not the whole dataset.  
2. **Scaling categories:** Don’t scale encoded categorical values (they aren’t “magnitudes”).  
3. **Outliers:** Min–Max and Z-score can get distorted. (Outlier-robust scaling is a later topic.)  

---

## Final Notes
Scaling is your **fairness tool** for features:  
- Normalization = squeeze into bounds.  
- Standardization = recenter + rescale.  
- Use them whenever magnitudes differ wildly **and** your model cares about distances or gradients.
