Every deep learning model asks itself the same thing after making a prediction:  

**“How wrong am I right now?”**  

The answer comes from a **cost function** (also called a loss function).  
It’s the model’s *scoreboard of mistakes* — telling it how far off it is, and how much it needs to adjust to get better.  

In this post, we’ll look at three essential cost functions, in **plain English** and with a **biology twist**:  

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Hinge Loss  
- Cross-Entropy  

---

## Mean Squared Error (MSE)

MSE is the most common cost function for **regression problems** — situations where we predict a continuous value, like tumor size, gene expression, or protein abundance.  

It measures the **average squared difference** between predictions and true values:  

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \big( y_i - \hat{y}_i \big)^2
$$

**In words:**  
- Find the difference between the true value (\(y_i\)) and predicted value (\(\hat{y}_i\)).  
- Square the difference (so negatives don’t cancel out, and big mistakes hurt more).  
- Average across all samples.
  
> MSE is a *perfectionist*. Small mistakes don’t bother it much, but big errors get punished heavily.

**Example:**  
If your model predicts a tumor volume of 3 cm³ when it’s actually 5 cm³, that’s an error of 2. Squared = 4.  
But if it predicts 1 cm³ instead of 5 cm³, the error is 4. Squared = 16.  
The second mistake looks *4x worse* even though it’s only twice as far off.

## Hinge Loss

Hinge loss is popular in **binary classification**, especially with Support Vector Machines (SVMs).  
It doesn’t just care about whether the prediction is right — it also checks if the model is **confident enough**.  

The formula for one prediction is:  

$$
\text{Hinge}(y_i, f(x_i)) = \max \big( 0, \, 1 - y_i \cdot f(x_i) \big)
$$

and for the whole dataset:  

$$
L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \max \big( 0, \, 1 - y_i \cdot f(x_i) \big)
$$

- \(y_i \in \{-1, +1\}\) are the true labels (e.g., benign vs malignant).  
- \(f(x_i)\) is the raw score from the model.  

**In words:**  
- If the model is right *and confident* → no loss.  
- If it’s right but unsure (too close to the decision boundary) → small loss.  
- If it’s wrong → big loss.  

> Think of hinge loss like a strict teacher. Even if you get the answer right, if you say it in a shaky voice, you still lose points.

**Example:**  
In medical diagnosis, hinge loss encourages models to separate healthy vs cancer patients with a *clear margin*, not just a guess that’s barely correct.

---

## Binary Cross-Entropy (Log Loss)

Cross-entropy is the **superstar for classification problems**.  
Instead of just asking “right or wrong?”, it looks at the **probabilities** behind the prediction.  

$$
\text{BCE} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Big[ y_i \log(\hat{p}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{p}_i) \Big]
$$

- \(y_i \in \{0,1\}\) = true label (e.g., 1 = disease, 0 = healthy).  
- \(\hat{p}_i\) = predicted probability of class 1 (disease).  

**In words:**  
- Confident **and correct** → very small loss.  
- Confident **but wrong** → huge loss.  
- Uncertain predictions → medium loss.  

> Cross-entropy *hates misplaced confidence*. If your model is 99% sure a tumor is benign but it’s actually malignant — the penalty is enormous.
{: .prompt-warning }

![Cross Entropy](https://tushar-bioinfo.github.io/learning-bioinformatics/assets/img/blog2/ceplot.png){: width="500" height="500" }

**Example:**  
If your model predicts 95% cancer when the patient really has cancer → tiny loss (great!).  
If it predicts 99% healthy when the patient has cancer → huge loss (disaster).  

This makes cross-entropy ideal for tasks like **disease subtype prediction**, where both correctness *and confidence* matter.

## Wrapping It Up

- **MSE** → Average of squared errors. Perfect for continuous predictions, punishes big mistakes harshly.  
- **Hinge Loss** → Encourages clear, confident classification with margins. Great when you need separation.  
- **Cross-Entropy** → Rewards correct confidence, punishes confident errors. Perfect for classification.  

At the end of the day, cost functions are just **different ways of saying “how wrong am I?”**  
They’re the compass that guides deep learning models through the training process, step by step, toward better predictions.  

>Think of cost functions as biology’s version of *fitness landscapes*. Just as evolution favors mutations that minimize survival cost, models evolve by minimizing error cost.
