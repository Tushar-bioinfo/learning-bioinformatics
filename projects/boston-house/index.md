# Boston Housing Price Prediction

**Duration:** _May 2025 – June 2025_  
**Tags:** `regression`, `sklearn`, `ML`

---

## Summary

This project builds a full machine learning pipeline using Python’s `scikit-learn` to predict Boston housing prices based on multiple features. It emphasizes feature engineering, statistical evaluation, model diagnostics, and performance visualization using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.

---

## ⚙What I Did

- Developed a linear regression model with **>80% R²** on test data.
- Performed **correlation analysis** and addressed multicollinearity using **VIF**.
- Evaluated the model using **RMSE**, residual plots, and prediction error analysis.
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline:
  _preprocessing → model training → threshold tuning → evaluation_.
- Visualized trends, confidence intervals, and residuals with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
