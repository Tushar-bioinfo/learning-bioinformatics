Hi, I’m **Tushar Singh**, currently pursuing my Master’s in **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology** at the University of South Florida.

I’ve been volunteering under **Dr. George Blanck** in the Department of Molecular Medicine at the Morsani College of Medicine. During this time, I’ve been deeply involved in **immunogenomics research**, where I learned to retrieve BAM files from the **Genomic Data Commons (GDC)** and **dbGaP**, and built a complete processing pipeline from scratch to convert `.sra` files into aligned `.bam` files. This pipeline enabled me to extract **VDJ recombination reads** using custom code developed by the Blanck Lab.

Alongside this, I’ve been developing my **own research paper** that explores the relationship between immune receptor **motif patterns and patient survival across different cancer types**.

I’ve also contributed to multiple other research projects within the lab, leading to **co-authorship on several manuscripts** currently under review.

I’m deeply passionate about learning and continuously improving myself. I consider my curiosity and competitive nature as key drivers that motivate me to explore new and challenging areas — which is what led me to machine learning. I plan to document and share my journey not just through ML-related projects, but also by writing tutorials and walkthroughs for biological data analysis workflows such as **single-nucleus RNA-seq**, **ChIP-seq**, and **data visualization techniques**.

My broader interests lie in **human health informatics**, **AI/ML in biology**, and **cancer research**, where I aim to combine analytical precision with meaningful biological impact.
