Hi, I’m Tushar Singh, a master’s student in bioinformatics and computational biology at the University of South Florida.

I’ve been volunteering under Dr. George Blanck in the Department of Molecular Medicine at the Morsani College of Medicine. During this time, I’ve worked on immunogenomics projects, where I started by learning to access BAM files from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) and dbGaP, and built a full pipeline from scratch to convert `.sra` files into aligned `.bam` files. This allowed me to extract VDJ recombination reads using custom code developed by the Blanck Lab.

Alongside this, I’ve been working on a personal research project exploring the relationship between immune receptor motif patterns and survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. I’ve also contributed to several ongoing projects in the lab and am listed as a co-author on multiple manuscripts currently under review.

I really enjoy learning and improving myself, and my competitive nature motivates me to dive deep into new topics. That’s what led me into machine learning—and now I’m exploring it alongside my core work in bioinformatics. I plan to share that journey through this blog, not only on ML but also on other biological workflows like single-nucleus RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and various data visualization tutorials.

My interests lie broadly in human health informatics, cancer research, and the intersection of AI and biology.
