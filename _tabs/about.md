Hi, I’m **Tushar** — a Master’s student in **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology** at the University of South Florida.  
I completed my undergraduate studies in **B.Sc. (Hons) Biotechnology**, where I developed a strong foundation in molecular biology, genomics, and data analysis.

Over time, my passion for biology merged with a growing curiosity in **AI/ML**, particularly their intersection in computational oncology and single-cell data analysis. I’ve worked on research projects involving **immune receptor motif enrichment**, **single-nucleus RNA-seq**, and **survival prediction models using machine learning**.

Outside of research, I’m passionate about communicating what I learn — simplifying complex ideas in computational biology and sharing my process openly. This site is a reflection of that journey.
